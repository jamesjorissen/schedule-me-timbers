# schedule-me-timbers

The goal of this project was to create a calendar with storage that also tracks the time and notifies the user via color-code if time has elapsed, time is current, or time is still to come.

This was the acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


I believe I have achieved all parameters.
